## Instructions and Navigations
On this repository you will find two branches: `main` and `final`. The `main` branch contains the Drupal website that
you have to style, along with the design system made with Storybook. The `final` branch contains the final result of the
website, with all the styles applied.

The [HOW-TO.md](HOW-TO.md) contains instructions on how to start the stack and build the website, and a set of useful
commands.
